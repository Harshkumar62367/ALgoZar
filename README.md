## Synopsis

Digital assets or as we are talking in this case NFTs, have become all the rage over the past few years. And as our world is becoming more dominated by technology, we’ve increasingly sought to turn the tangible into the digital. Today, the NFT market has over a $10 billion market cap and with new potential imapctful projects coming in web3 ecosystem everyday, this number will surely move further up. So to build a NFT space in Algorand and bringing more traffic towards Algorand NFTs and building 'hype' of Algorand NFTs, we have prepared this NFT marketing strategy <b>AlgoZar.</b>

AlgoZar is a marketing strategy put down for preparing the hype around the Algorand Blockchain, along with increasing traffic towards Algorand marketplaces, attracting more digital artists and increasing the social media awareness and presence of Algorand NFTs.   
AlgoZar uses **AARRR** metrics framework for leading the growth along with making it simpler for product management and efiiciently managing the marketing efforts along with improving the initiatives that are not working.
<br>
So, what's this AARRR metrics we are talking about. Let's simplified it a bit:- 

- **A - Acquisition**(or awareness):  Acquisition refers to all of the channels we use to introduce people to our product. It gives us the metrics of how people are discovering our product or in this case our Algo NFTs.
- **A - Activation**:  Activation refers to users taking the desired actions that we want them to, or in this case are they checking our Algorand NFT marketplaces, connecting their wallet or even buying a NFT.
- **R - Retention**:  Retention refers to the "active new users" that we have persuaded to take action, are they coming back to our Marketplace platform again and still show interest in our NFTs.
- **R - Referral**:  Referral refers to the active users, are they recommending our Algorand NFTs to more of their freinds or family members.
- **R - Revenue**: Revenue is an essential metric as it will let us know what projects are generating revenue and what strategy is not working for Algorand NFTs.

### Algorand NFT Market Analysis

Even after being one of the fastest blockchain, Algorand still has a low NFT adoption when compared to other chains. According to `https://www.nftexplorer.app/`, there are more than 2 million NFTs minted on Algorand Blockchain till date that had lead to less than half a million individual sales worth around 50 million ALGO. This data when compared to chains of similar size like Binance Smart Chain(BSC) shows that the Algorand blockchain is still lagging in NFT adoption.  
Also if we compare recent data, the total volume of ALGO traded for NFTs is down by 30% for the last 30 days, which makes it very necessary to put out a creative and innovational NFT marketing strategy to not only capture the NFT market but to onboard new users and contributors to Algorand NFTs community.

## AlgoZar strategy

Let's get the work started and talk about AlgoZar marketing startegy for building Algorand NFTs hype through AARRR framework. We will also cover the budget that we need for this marketing startegy to work, and will put down steps through which we can check the initiatives that are not working.


### Acquisition

Acquisition or awareness efers to all of the channels we will use to introduce people to Algorand NFTs. It will be the most useful metric as without this no one will know about Algorand NFTs. Let's divide the awareness program in different activities to properly manage it.

<b>Activity 1: Contribute to Earn platforms</b>

- Contribute-to-earn (C2E) platfroms is now all over the web3 industry, and many platforms are using to not only increase their user base, but for identifying potential contributors for the projects also. 
- With help of C2E platform, Algorand projects can urge the users to follow their social handles in exchange of some rewards.

- Some major C2E platform in the web3 industry that can be used by Algorand for promoting their NFTs are PymeId, Quest3, Crew3, Dappback.
- Crew3 alone has more than 1000+ projects of different ecosystem listed on its platform, and helps the projects in their community growth and creating social media presence.
- We should also give out some free NFTs as in replace of doing tasks on C2E platforms, that only will increase our wallet base, but will help in community growth of Algo NFTs.
- The NFTs rewarded can only be seen at the marketplaces, which will increase the traffic towards ALgorand NFT marketplaces.
            
<b>Activity 2: Social Media Activity</b>

- Conducting frequent AMAs for Algorand NFT projects that help the proejct to get some new user base.
- Meme competitions also helps many NFT projects to create enegagemnt in Social Media.
- Frequent eduactional content about ASA standards that help the community learn about Algorand NFTS.
- Putting out campaigns on C2E platform for like/retweet a spacific tweet and build some social media presence.
- Twitter, Discord and Telegram are the most major social media platforms that will be used for this activity.
- Social Media activities or post should always be checked for SEOs to make them competitive with other chains or projects posts.

<b>Activity 3: NFT hackathons & bootcamps</b>

- Conducting NFT related hackatons to increase digital artists base in ALgorand.
- Using popular hackathons platform to increase the base for hackathon.

### Activation

Activation is the metric where users take the desired actions that we want them to, or in this case are they checking our Algorand NFT marketplaces, connecting their wallet or even buying the NFT. Now, we have made users aware about our NFTs, this is the second major metric that is divided in many small metric to ensure the activation growth.  
Most of the activity that we plan in the acquisition part will have the domino effect for the activation part. Also this is the metric where we can show the users the capabilities of Algorand NFTs, and why it is better than its counterparts. Let's put down some activities for the activation metric.


<b>Activity 1: Algorand NFT incentivization</b>

- People are more likely to engage with Algorand marketplace if there is something in it for them. Consider offering incentives such as free NFTs, ALGO tokens to giveaway for using platform for a small time.
- We can incentivize C2E points of the C@E platforms for users that complete the tasks that we want to do them, like opening a algorand wallet address, purchasing a NFT.
- NFT giveaways on Social media will prompt many users to check and open wallet for Algorand.

<b>Activity 2: User Experience</b>

- Ensure our NFT marketplace is user-friendly and easy to navigate. This can help attract more visitors and keep them coming back. A smooth, fast, and intuitive interface can make all the difference in attracting users and keeping them engaged.
- Ensuring that our NFT maretplaces have inbuilt tools for digital artists to publish NFTs on the platform without the help of code.

It would have no problem of losing as well their authenticity can be proved and maintained.
Subscriptions in the form of NFTs: Service Subscriptions are an avoidable part of our lives today. Sometimes it is hard to track down the money spent on these but what if we have a NFT in our wallet to signify our purchase with all the necessary details on it, wouldn't it be super easy to track and manage. And what if we could add a possibility to sell the subscription to some other individuals too, in case somebody doesn't want to keep . NFTs would be quite manageable,trackable and authentic in this scenario.
