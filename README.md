And as our world is becoming more dominated by technology, weâ€™ve increasingly sought to turn the tangible into the digital. Today, the NFT market has over a $10 billion market cap and with new potential imapctful projects coming in web3 ecosystem everyday, this number will surely move further up.

AlgoZar is a marketing strategy put down for preparing the hype around the Algorand Blockchain, along with increasing traffic towards Algorand marketplaces, attracting more digital artists and increasing the social media awareness and presence of Algorand NFTs.

<br>
So, what's this AARRR metrics we are talking about. Let's simplified it a bit:- 

- **A - Acquisition**(or awareness):  Acquisition refers to all of the channels we use to introduce people to our product. It gives us the metrics of how people are discovering our product or in this case our Algo NFTs.
- **A - Activation**:  Activation refers to users taking the desired actions that we want them to, or in this case are they checking our Algorand NFT marketplaces, connecting their wallet or even buying a NFT.
- **R - Retention**:  Retention refers to the "active new users" that we have persuaded to take action, are they coming back to our Marketplace platform again and still show interest in our NFTs.
- **R - Referral**:  Referral refers to the active users, are they recommending our Algorand NFTs to more of their freinds or family members.
- **R - Revenue**: Revenue is an essential metric as it will let us know what projects are generating revenue and what strategy is not working for Algorand NFTs.

### Algorand NFT Market Analysis

Even after being one of the fastest blockchain, Algorand still has a low NFT adoption when compared to other chains. According to `https://www.nftexplorer.app/`, there are more than 2 million NFTs minted on Algorand Blockchain till date that had lead to less than half a million individual sales worth around 50 million ALGO. This data when compared to chains of similar size like Binance Smart Chain(BSC) shows that the Algorand blockchain is still lagging in NFT adoption.  
Also if we compare recent data, the total volume of ALGO traded for NFTs is down by 30% for the last 30 days, which makes it very necessary to put out a creative and innovational NFT marketing strategy to not only capture the NFT market but to onboard new users and contributors to Algorand NFTs community.

###Nikhil

Algorand is a fast,secure and cheap blockchain to mint,sell and trade NFTs. Its PPoS Consensus protocol has a major part in making it fast and reliable. With the growing trend and market of NFTsÂ , the opportunities for increasing the NFT marketshare has also increasedÂ . This brings out enormous opportunities for Algorand too to expand its market cover in NFTs. Some of them can be:
Expanding in Technical Institutions: It could be a area of enormous possibilites to increase the demand of NFTs. NFTs can be embedded in the ID Cards of studentsÂ ,and  their degrees can too be provided in the form of NFTs. Apart from these full time NFTsÂ , these can also be used in the form passes for events that are organised in the Institutions. Furthermore, Hall Tickets and gradecards can also be embedded in the form of NFTs.

Subscriptions in the form of NFTs: Service Subscriptions are an avoidable part of our lives today. Sometimes it is hard to track down the money spent on these but what if we have a NFT in our wallet to signify our purchase with all the necessary details on it, wouldn't it be super easy to track and manage. And what if we could add a possibility to sell the subscription to some other individuals too, in case somebody doesn't want to keepÂ . NFTs would be quite manageable,trackable and authentic in this scenario.
